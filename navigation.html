<h1>NAVIGATION </h1>
<p> we started to make navigation button </p>
<h2> FIRST </h2>
<img src="buttonscreenshot/screenshot1.png" width="400">
<p> make a square with the rectangle tool and write "home" inside. </p>

<h2> SECOND </h2>
<img src="buttonscreenshot/screenshot2.png" width="400">
<p> select the rectangle and click the right and click "convert to symbol". </p>
<img src="buttonscreenshot/screenshot3.png" width="400">
<p> if you clicked the "convert to symbol", a small box will appear. when it appears, click "button" and "Enable 9-slice scaling guides". </p> 

<h2> THIRD </h2>
<img src="buttonscreenshot/screenshot4.png" width="400"> 
<p> after that drag the "home" button from the right (this will you have the same button easily.) </p>

<img src="buttonscreenshot/screenshot5.png" width="500">
<p> since it was copied from the original, the buttons will all name "Home". 
So in order to change it, go to the bottom, click the box and change it </p>

<h2> FOURTH</h2>
<img src="buttonscreenshot/screenshot6.png" width="400">
<p> in order to let the button to look like a button, go to filters. 
in there, there will be lots of option. go to the bottom where there's a box called "bevel and emboss" and then click "Inner bevel". </p>

<img src="buttonscreenshot/screenshot7.png" width="400">
<p> go to stat and "change" up to "over" </p>

<img src="buttonscreenshot/screenshot8.png" width="400">
<p> after that, click "copy up graphic". when you click this, you can change the color of the button 
without changing the original color. Repeat this with "down" too.</p>

<h2> FIFTH </h2>
<img src="buttonscreenshot/screenshot9.png" width="500">
<p> when the button is finished, go to "file", find "preview in browser" and click 
"preview in safari" to look at your work. </p>

<h2> IN DREAMWEAVER </h2>
<img src="buttonscreenshot/screenshot10.png" width="400">
<p> the button will eventually work, you just have to link it with the page you want. and 
if you want the hovering, you have to copy and paste the link of the button to dreamweaver</p>

</ul>
